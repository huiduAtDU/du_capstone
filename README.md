# Obejective
[Generative Dog Images](https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images/overview)

The obejective of this capstone project is learning and using generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate creative dogs images. In this project, I will use training skills to train 20K dog files like Chihuahua, Japanese-spaniel, Pekinese, etc. Then training a generative model (GAN) to generative dogs image automatic.

# Motivation
Generative methods (in particular, GANs) are currently used in various places on Kaggle for data augmentation. Their potential is vast; they can learn to mimic any distribution of data across any domain: photographs, drawings, music, and prose. If successful, not only will you help advance the state of the art in generative image creation, but youâ€™ll enable us to create more experiments across a variety of domains in the future.

# Dataset
There are 20579 dog image files as train file, the test file are 10,000 dog images sized 64x64 generated automatically by GAN.

# Things to Do
- Data exploring
- Image processing
- GAN network building
- Parameters fitting 
- Dog files generating
